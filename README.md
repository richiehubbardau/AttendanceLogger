# Attendance Logger How-To-Use!

In a world where plastic straws are evil and you now have too *cut* up your lunch with wooden sporks, it is about time we start to take a look around our offices, classrooms & kitchens (I'm looking at you paper plates!) and seeing if we can find digital solutions to replace these manual tasks, think of the forests - And not to mention all the unnecessary admin work to duplicate this into an electronic system.

With my eco-warrior cloak & digitizing stare, I look around the classroom, there's a daily task which both annoys me & confuses me, the attendance log is still on paper!

The solution is easy, a program must be written which will allow students to log their attendance digitally, that will allow the staff to view each students attendance and check the frequency on which they have been attending class.

## How will this change the everyday lives of students & teachers?

Each day as students attend class, they will be able too use their student ID too login to their systems & mark themselves as attended.

A student will be able to check their attendance & retrieve statistics about how often they have attended their classes.

As all students are now fellow eco-warriors, they will have this warm fuzzy feeling each day knowing that after 6 months, they have potentially saved a tree (branch)

Admin/Teachers will be able to monitor attendance, having the ability to change days, time & add/remove students from the course. While they may still be climate change deniers, they won't be able to deny how much easier a system, that requires them to do less work is!

Admins will be able to edit the default config, advising what days are included in the semester and remove any public holidays.

This will all be published to a LOCAL or REMOTE database depending on the configuration file.
